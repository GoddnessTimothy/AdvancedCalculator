  
  Geometric Calculator v0.2: (rewrite with new skills I have learned).  The return of a long forgotten project!
            A breathe of fresh air
            Will utilize loops, functions, vectors, arrays 
            Efficient code
            Better logic
            Cleaner source code
            Easier to follow and understand
            Calculations:
              Area
                Perimeter
                Circumference
                Surface Area
                Volume
                Type of triangle
                Equalaterial

                    frustum
                    truncated cone
        
                Functionality
                    Accurately calculate values for each shape
                    Check for negative values.  All calulations and inputs must be positive
                    Check for invalid entries such as an input not listed. (A-E) user chooses F
                    Code must be logical
                    Use functions to organize calculations (geometric shapes, polygons) || for greetings, menu list, error handling
                    Error handling and test cases
